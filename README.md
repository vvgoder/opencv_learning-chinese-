# Notes of learning Opencv in Python Language

 python version 3.7 is available, maybe other versions will do as well
 
Some annotations in Chinese and others in English

# IDE 
In this repository I use vs-code as IDE

You can see the ANNOTATION #%% that means the **run cell** button in VS CODE


# Opencv version 

Some functions didn't work in lastest opencv-python version

so if you want to run it successfully ,you can change the version to ***3.4.2.16***

use  "pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.16"  to enable
